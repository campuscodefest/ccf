      The CoEventer idea originated with Chad and Dave, both staff at the University of Minnesota, in 2013. We wanted to fire up the University developer community and begin solidifying working relationships accross our many departments. The end result was Campus Codefest 2013. After the first event, we learned what event planning, idea collecting, and other related tools were missing for such events and Dave decided to start filling in the gaps. Two years later, we are releasing CoEventer.

      A short video was produced during this first event, which provides a great idea of the appeal of one of these events:

      The CoEventer application is an open source project. A number of individuals have contributed, including those who participated in Campus Codefest. Feel free to provide feedback on our GitHub project.
